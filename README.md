A unity package to support creating a Craftopia's mod based on LibCraftopia


## Requirements

Craftopia is constructed on Unity 2020.1.3f1. Therefore, I suppose to work this package in that version.

```

## Usage

After installing this package, you can see the `LibCraftopia` in the menu bar. Click `LibCraftopia/Initiate` first. Then, you can see the `LibCraftopia` asset in `Assets` folder. You can configure this package via the inspector of the `LibCraftopia` asset.

## Remark

Currently, you may see a lot of errors like `Could not delete file '*.dll'`. Don't afraid that; these errors are ignorable.
